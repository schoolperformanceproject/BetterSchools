### PROJECT: TEA STUDENT DATA ANALYSIS

### TEAM MEMBERS

* Aditi Sharma
* Christopher Lucas
* Nish Garg
* Bill Wilson
* Nelson Wang

### PROJECT DESCRIPTION/OUTLINE
Our project will analyze education data to discover relationships that lead to conclusions that will help inform curriculum design and classroom instructions.

### RESEARCH QUESTIONS TO ANSWER
* Is there a relationship between teacher data (length of time in classroom, salary, highest degree earned) and student achievement?
* Is there a relationship between geographic location and student achievement?
* Is there a relationship between poverty and student achievement?
* If these relationships exist, what conclusions can we draw to implement practices that will improve student outcomes.

### DATA SOURCES OR DATA SETS TO BE USED
Data downloads from the Texas Academic Performance Report issued each year by the Texas Education Agency (https://rptsvr1.tea.texas.gov/perfreport/tapr/2017/download/DownloadData.html). Downloads from other years can be accessed by simply changing the year in the url.

### APIS TO BE CONSUMED (IF ANY)
None

### ROUGH BREAKDOWN OF TASKS:
1. Architect the data flow:
	* Decide on how to show the data, graphs types , numbers etc
 	* Identifying data needed from files and its mapping from data files
  	* Define panada data frames.
	* Define aggregated dataframes
	* Determine the scope for parsing functions
	* Define plots and its functions
	* Decide on Deploying platform if needed
	* Document this on wiki

2. Gather data: 
	  * Create keys and authentication if any --define gateway
	  * Create function to extract the data into dataframe

3. Check the validity of data:
	  * Create functions to parse the data
	  * Create function to validate integrity of data and fix if necessary

4. Create aggregation
	  * Perform needed aggregation on data for plots.
	  * Create functions/code for sampling/custom group.
   
5. plot
	  * Create function for plots.
	  * create mechanism for colors/bins like dictionaries etc.
	
6. Deploying 
	  * Put everything together.
	  * Deploying the code.

7. Prepare for demo and presentations
	  * Create documentation of the code on wiki--finalizing .
	  * Test the demo.
	  * Make presentation.
